0,"I had the Samsung A600 for awhile which is absolute doo doo. You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing. It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it. Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc. Overall: Okay phone. It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint. Why get so so when you can get great?"
1,"Due to a software issue between Nokia and Sprint this phone's text messaging capabilities don't work with Sprint's system and won't until a software patch comes out ""some time in the next few months"". You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint's award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed ""offline"" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out. Innovation in money-making at its finest."
2,"This is a great, reliable phone. I also purchased this phone after my samsung A460 died. The menu is easily comprehendable and speed dialing is available for around 300 numbers. Voice dialing is also a nice feature, but it takes longer than speed dialing. The only thing that bothers me is the games...Nokia seems to have taken snake (1 and 2) off their phones. There is a skydiving game, bowling, and tennis (like pong). The ringers are very nice, and a feature is available to choose a different ringer for each person calling. However, ringtones are not available online to download to this phone. You're pretty much stuck with what you have. There are vibrating ringtones and regular (midi) polyphonic tones. All they need are covers in a reasonable price range..."
3,"I love the phone and all, because I really did need one, but I didn't expect the price of the bill when I received one. Also, I've had my phone for a little over two months now and still have yet to receive my free accessories that were supposed to come with the phone. Every time I call the company, they keep telling me to wait a couple of weeks, and that I should be receiving it shortly. Other than that, I do love the phone and all that I am able to do with it; and I'm not just talking about making the phone calls! :)"
4,"The phone has been great for every purpose it offers, except the day i bought it-i couldnt get the case off. You can take the case off to put your own pictures in the jaket which is super cool, but when i took it back to the store-an employee said they were meant to be hard to get off. Well, he could barely even get it off- he came close to snapping the casing in half. I was never able to get it off after that which isnt THAT big of a deal, but it got dirty under the clear casing and it looks really dirty now. MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET YOUR CASE ON AND OFF! Oh and you have to charge it ALL off the time."
6,"Cool. Cheap. Color: 3 words that describe the Nokia 3588 perfectly. I mean, what more DO you want? This beauty's got classic, sleek looks that jerks you a little about a Nokia 3310's looks. The 3588 also has some amazing ringtones. And I own a cellphone shop, so I have the experience. I RATE THIS THE 5TH BEST PHONE THAT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IN MY STORE. Do you need more prompting to buy this, pal? Well, then here it comes!: The Nokia 3599 includes an alarm clock, calendar, voice recorder, calculator and stopwatch . And trust me, its good value for money if you're on a tight budget. And oh, if you're thinking of getting this for a teenager, you've come to the right phone; they'll go crazy after its looks AND its color LCD (which happens to be a little oversize). If this phone's goin' for an adult, you've hit da soda pop again, you lucky person! NOW are ya convinced that this mobile's REAL! (it is)."
7,"The 3599i is overall a nice phone, except that Nokia made its universal headset jack incompatible with most 2.5mm universal headsets (even their own). A phone call to tech support was required to find out that you need to buy a headset that plugs into the Pop-port accessory connector on the bottom of the phone. They ended up suggesting the HDB-5 headset."
8,"I've never owned a Nokia phone before, so this is a first for me. I really like the phone alot, the reception is great...even though the signal strength show's being low. The quality of the phone is great too, it feels sturdy and weighted. I highly recommend this phone."
9,ok well im in school and i need the text messaging and ive had this phone for about a month and text messaging was supposed to start working 2weeks ago.A conflict of software type stuff and btween nokia and sprint.(Its down to 4 stars) And the fact it cant download ringtones.(3stars)Or games(2 stars)But you cant beat a nearfree or free color phone(back to 3 stars) as soon as it gets text messaging it should b 4 stars.
10,"I've had this phone for over a year and I really like it. Having never been partial to flip phones, I can appreciate this Nokia's features. The color screen is very nice and all of the features are easy to use. The keylock is a simple two-button sequence though I do wish it had a timer for the keylock like my old phone. It has a lot of useful features, like a calculator, organizer, stopwatch and alarm, but the three games it has are too lame to play. The customizable features are nice, but lacking in variety. This isn't the ideal phone for a guy. You're few options are pretty girly. The ringtones also lack something to be desired, but there are a few decent ones. The battery life is pretty good, nothing special, but definitely not bad. It gets me through the average day without problems and sometimes lasts for several days. My parents, sisters, and husband all got fancy Samsung flip phones with cameras and all the toys, and I must say mine works better. The battery lasts MUCH longer and the recpetion is MUCH better. The downside to this cute phone is the case. It's made of very weak plastic that cracked in a few months. Also, if you're thinking about getting a different case for it, DON'T! Once you take it off, it will keep slipping off. It never attaches firmly again, and neither does the new case you bought. I've read this in other reviews too. Because of this, the last time I dropped it the back piece popped off and the battery flew out. Now my phone has issues. Drat. Overall, it's a great phone, if you're content with the simpler things in life. Who really uses the camera on thier phone anyway? I just reccommend buying a protective case for it and leaving it on and don't drop the delicate thing."
11,"1.) Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.) Heavy - Speaks for itself...the phone weighs way too much. 5.) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks for itself. My recommendation: buy a better phone. This one will only make you cry at night."
12,"I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them."
13,This is an excellent choice for Sprint to use when enrolling new customers for service. It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket. This can be annoying if you get used to owning a flip phone before moving to the Nokia.
43,"This phone isn't kidding when it says military specs. I had a hole in my pocket and it went tumbling down a flight of concrete steps (20 steps). It had a few scratches but it worked fine. It also made a few other death - defying leaps. It is VERY drop resistant. That being said, it is not crush proof. It's battery was just about dead so I decided to leave it in the car to charge. I plugged it into the car charger, grabbed my purse, and got out of the car. Unbeknownst to me, the charger cord was tangled around my purse. I stood up and closed the car door - right on this phone. That left a BIG mark - that finally did it in (If it still worked, I would have had the world's first boomerang phone - it looked just like a boomerang afterwards). I just ordered a new one. As much as I beat up my last phone and as well as it fared, I had to get another one. My only pet peeve with this phone is they could have at least given me ONE full game - not the lame demos that are included with it. The phone itself is about the size of a Hershey bar. I often keep it in my pants pocket (the front pocket)."
44,I bought this phone and found out IDEN phones with sim cards are no longer eligible for service with Boost Mobile. So buyer be ware dont buy these unless you already have service with a sim card.
49,"PHONE DID NOT COME WITH A SIM CARD....INFORMATION I WOULD'VE LIKED TO HAVE..... PHONE WORKS FINE, BUT BECAUSE PTT (WALKIE) IS BEING PHASED-OUT ON BOOST, NO SIM. RATING IS FOR PHONE, BUT VERY UNHAPPY NOT TO HAVE ALL THE FACTS PRIOR TO PURCHASE."
53,Wouldn't know anything about the cell phone I ordered because the person hasn't even shipped it yet. It's been a month! And amazon has does nothing to help and really has nothing for an option to provide assistance.
54,"For someone needing a very basic phone and services (i.e., no email access, no camera, etc.) this phone is quite good. The sound quality on both the built in speaker and mic and the speaker phone are very good, the phone itself is very portable and it has buttons one does not have to be a midget to operate. On the negative side (and why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars), it has a relatively small battery for its size, as anyone who has opened but back to install can attest. Hence the battery power for such a basic phone is not on a par with other ""basic"" phones, though not by much. A second critique is the very small screen which is, in addition, not very well lit. It can be a problem viewing, even in the shade. A third problem is that the interface for some of the features (i.e., voice recorder, contact list) is not as easy as it should be. Thanks to the small screen, one needs to scroll quite a bit to access some of the phone's features. One last critique is that the messaging service is quite slow. Hence if you need to use such a feature this phone is far from optimal. All and all a very good phone despite the weaknesses cited above. If someone is looking for a barebones phone this is more than fulfills the requirements."
55,"I am a professional who recently purchased a Sanyo Juno phone to use as an extra special-purpose business phone. After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with? I deeply regret selecting to business with this company."
57,"This phone is awesome. I have one through Boost Mobile with the unlimited plan. Bought it on August 6th and no regrets. People that whine and complain about the screen res or no games. It's a phone people, nothing more, nothing less. I use the walkie-talkie regularly, my wife and I text back and forth daily with no missed or missing messages. This phone receives/makes calls and walkie-talkie's where others have failed. If people want games buy a Gameboy, want pictures buy a camera, not real hard to figure out. This little gem was built to be a phone and that's exactly what it is. In short.... See it as it really is, a phone."
59,"I find texting impossible on this phone. As another reviewer said, the screen goes blank randomly and you have to turn it off and on again. Also the phone randomly turns off phone transmissions and you have to turn it back on to receive/make phone calls. There has to be better phones out there."
60,"I recently had an i776 which was ruined at work. I had good service with it and it worked well. I spent $50 on this piece, the service is horrible, very patchy. I don't receive texts, sometimes the screens goes white for no reason. The key pad lights stopped working, the phone has no alarm. The battery doesn't last more than a day. I have only had to phone for two months. Its the worst phone ive owned, do not buy this. The i776 is a good phone,but you have to buy the rugged version."
61,I LOVE THIS PHONE! YES I WOULD LOVE IT TO HAVE MORE FEATURES BUT I LOVE THIS PHONE! THE SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT! I COULD BE DOING LAUNDRY AND BE TALKING IN SPEAKER AND HEAR AND BE HERD PERFECTLY WITHOUT THE ECKO MOST PHONES MAKE TO WHO EVER IS LISTENING TO YOU THE WEB IS NORMAL LIKE ANY OTHER PHONE THE TEXING IS GOOD ASS WELL OVERALL THIS PHONE WON ME OVER WITH ITS SOUND QUALITY IVE HAD SO MANY PHONES VERY LOW ON SOUND THIS PHONE IS PERFECT I HAD THE OTHER PHONE THE $[...]. ONE BUT UPGRADED TO THIS ONE AND LOVE IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONE ITS VERY EASY TO TIPE THE BUTTONS ARE NOT HARD AT ALL LOVE THIS PHONE.
62,"This phone is JUNK. Do NOT buy this phone. You will have much faster messaging via regular USPS. Your text messages will be lost in the vast time warp of boost mobilism where they will stay until you decide to try to use the internet on this phone. While waiting the regular 15 minutes for a webpage to load, you will be bumrushed by a million of delayed texts which will obliterate all the efforts this sorry little phone has put forth in trying to load the webpage. The screen will turn white and the entire phone will reset on its own. You will then have the responsibility of manually turning your transmitters back on for the phone to work again. If you are arguing with a girlfriend on this phone, she will dump you because she will think you have hung up on her. If you have close family members, they will abandon you and make pacts with other family members not to call or text you because you never text back and hardly ever answer. If you are having an affair with a married woman, this phone will hold all the messages you sent to her until her husband has come home. Then, like magic, this phone will deliver all the long lost messages as soon as he picks up his wife's phone. They should reaname this phone the i666. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for this phone, but common sense makes one wonder if it wasn't created by a more sinister power. Possibly Satan himself."
63,it withstands a lot and is worth the money only thing IT DOESNT HAVE A CAMERA
64,"This was a replacement for the one my mom had that went south on us. Can't really complain about it because the problem with this device is the carrier not the phone. Probably should give it five stars because the seller gave a spot on description, gave a charger, and threw in a case for free but yet again my carrier doesn't seem to like the phone. I did receive this package next day."
65,"The shipping time on the phone was great, The phone also works great and as it is supose to, My sims card had no problems as some stated theirs did, great battery life, nice looking phone. Work in a area that my other phone had no signal this phone does when clear out, Not so good when cloudy, But would buy again from seller. Thank you Mark"
68,"They are showing a cingular phone which is identical to the one that I had ,Instead I got an AT&tT.It is okay but yhe cingular phone has more options."
70,"this phone was the one my husband got when we first opened our cell account many years ago. He is not open to change and I wasn't sure i could get this phone again. I am very glad I was able to get it for him, and it is working quite well. Thank you."
73,"It's a nice phone only if it worked properly. I can answer the phone but can't hear the person on the line I have to put the phone on speaker in order to hear, this causes people to hang up because the phone's a piece of junk. this started happen two days after I got the phone.....a bad choice."
76,"Short: This phone works fine as a basic phone, if that is all you are looking for. Long: My old phone's LCD croaked on me, and I wanted to wait a bit before buying an HTC Dream, so I went with this cheap phone. Complaints: Menu/key response is sometimes slow. No way to get data to phone via USB cable, at least if you live in the US. It seems like a USB cable exists (in Europe, Asia and Australia) but it costs about as much as the phone itself does after exchange rates. If you go to [...], they talk about cable CA-126, which works with the 1680. It has a regular usb connector on one end, and a Nokia microusb & 2.5mm charger plug on the other. The US Nokia manual says the Microusb port is for ""authorized personal only"", which to my mind says that the carriers in the US wanted to force people into getting things onto the phone via some $$$-chargeable method. In any event, I'll be getting a new phone in a few months so I'll live with this phone for now. But the limitations it has makes it so that it is only suitable for those who are not looking for anything other than making/receiving phone calls (like my parents)."
78,"I needed a replacement phone, and did not want to sign up for a new contract, so I bought a Nokia 1680c at the full retail price. This phone is a good value. It rings loud & clear, and the speakerphone is easy to hear. People I'm calling say my voice is clear, though they can tell I'm on a cell phone. It has a lot of neat software features; for example, you can configure a shortcut action for the left and right softkeys, as well the Up-Down-Left-Right buttons. There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a ""+"" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example ""+15551212121"" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example. Overall, I like this phone, and will probably keep it until I someday feel the need to get a smartphone-type slab of electronics."
79,"This is probably the wrost experience i had with Amazon and it costed me $72.00. Both my phones from amazon arrived inright time but without activation. I called AT&T and they could not locate our phone numbers so had to call back amazon and learned that they have not activated our phones. Amazon customer service took good amount of time to do this meanwhile i missed by billing cycle with old cell phone company. This process took about a week, and not to mention the SIM card delivered was not working and amazon had to ship again."
80,"By simple I mean that in a good way, having come from an Envy 2 I am glad to be able to open the phone and dial and not have to deal with clicking OK twice to unlock the ""locked"" screen. Quotes intentional, the screen was only locked when I needed to urgently make a call but had a lot of phantom dialing while in my pocket. So back to the Alias 2 the phone is easy to figure out but does not work in all the ways it is said to work. Specifically I can not get this phone to pair with my blue tooth in my new car. I tried, the car dealer tried and while NO issues are reported with this phone and its blue tooth capabilities I beg to differ! I read another review of a person who had exact same trouble with a different model car and was also told the phone is fine. It is obviously something unique to this model only because other samsung phones pair without problems. I got my phone exchanged and after going through that it still will not pair with my car. I wanted this phone because it is simpler than the previous envy 2 I owned but even that phone will pair with my car. I plan to switch to a smart phone as soon as the Nexus One comes to verizon. Considering the very large increase in the monthly charges they will thus receive and extending my contract I sincerely hope they work as hard to keep the customer happy as they say they do. This customer is not terribly happy right now! I will say that the network is the strongest for my area so I hope to stick with verizon but can and will change if they wont try and keep me satisfied."
81,"Just recently got this phone as a replacement to my i760 and am happy to be back to a flip phone. Great Camera, have not tested video yet. Battery life is solid. I'll give samsung credit for the rotating/changable keyboard, a cool thing for the next model might be a customizable keyboard where you have the ability to assign values to each key. As far as ease of use for the keyboard...I havent had any problems and I have large hands/fingers. It takes a little getting used to but once acclimated you should have no problems. I cant comment on voice recognition or blue tooth as I dont really use those features and honestly find them useless (once in a while I'll use my ear piece in the car but its rare). I also dont plan on using it as an MP3 player...I have an ipod for that. If your looking for a phone to synch with outlook then find one where that is offered in the specs. Yes you can remotely sync and get access to web email but nowhere in the description is outlook mentioned so I cant hold that against the phone. It would be like faulting my car cause it doesnt fly (I know thats an exageration but its kinda the same thing) when its clearly not meant for that. If you need a phone that syncs with outlook then get a pda phone. This is basically your standard flip with a few extra features and probly wont be as popular with the mickey mouse club kids that want an iPhone like device that they can watch movies on and giggle over the txts their friends just sent. Interface is about the same as any other VZ flip phone I've had in the past. The ability to use a 16gb micro sd is also a nice feature and is especially handy if you have a card reader on your pc/laptop. All in all its a solid phone that serves the purpose its intended for...a phone thats easy to txt on and make calls on."
82,"Good overall phone, bluetooth so far syncs well with the integrated bluetooth in a Mercedes that I used to have and also with the aftermarket Alpine stereo that I have in my VW. But some of the features and design are just poor and/or not thought out. Looks great but the body is far too slippery. It's like handling a bar of soap. I use it as my primary alarm clock in the morning and it's really clumsy to grab off the nightstand and shut off the alarm. Even when I'm fully awake and alert :-) it's hard to open and I've dropped it a few times while fumbling to open it. There is a wider slit on the clamshell lid to fit your finger into when opening in portrait mode but in landscape mode there's no place to insert your finger to flip it open, so you have to use your fingernail. Unlike my previous phone, it takes two hands almost all the time to open this thing whereas my old phone I could easily flip it open with one hand. I wish the alarm clock's snooze function was like most clock radios where it allows 10 minutes snooze time, not 5. 5 is just too short. Or, the phone should allow you to set the snooze period as a preference. There is no way to display the time on the front screen when the phone is dark; you have to open it up. Well, you can fake it by holding the lock button for the music keys, which will light up the display) but then you have to hold it a second time to reset the lock/unlock back to where you had it. Also, when you're on a call (although just about every cell phone fails on this) the clock doesn't display anywhere (so this is no better than other phones). How many times have you been on a call and said ""Hey let's meet later!"" and the person asks you ""Ok, what time is it now?"" and you can't tell. (I quit wearing watches because of the clocks on cell phones...but why don't they display the time when on a call?) The keys on the outside aren't too bad except the volume up/down is a little too easy to accidentally press. I like the keyboard idea overall but I find it's like typing on little Chiclet gum candies. I need to use my fingernails to avoid fat-fingering it. In QWERTY mode, the END button is too close to the space bar and I have inadvertantly killed my web browser when typing a space in a field on a page. Frustrating! With the END key was farther away. Wish they would have also engineered in some page up/down keys too, as scrolling line by line is cumbersome. I would also like the END and SEND keys to somehow be the traditional red and green colors too. I use Outlook on my netbook to ""sync"" (sort of) my contacts to the phone. This works alright but if you want to refresh your contacts you have to delete them all from the phone and then resend them over or they'll be duplicates. This is a bit annoying only in that you will then need to re-enter the ICE contacts manually. The bluetooth can send pics to my netbook, but only one at a time (cumbersome). Can't select multiple photos at once. Won't send videos at all to my netbook via Bluetooth. Have to send them via a picture message to email and fake it that way but you incur data usage charges doing it that way. Or you can use removable storage on the MicroSD card to do it. The biggest disappointment is the calendar. What a useless piece of junk! It says you can send calendar appointments to the phone, which you can, but it is half-baked. If you set a reminder in Outlook, the reminder doesn't carry over to the phone. The phone only supports one text field for the appointment and it corresponds to the Outlook appointment body (not the header meeting description nor location), so I have to retype the description and location in the Outlook calendar body if I want to see anything useful on the phone. Even then, some appointments come over with an empty text field on the phone (it is either a problem with the text being too long and/or having a carriage return in the text I think). So if I try to then enter it on the phone (enter the description in the displayed (and empty) text field), the phone freezes and then reboots. Terrible! The recurring meeting also is miserably half-baked. You cannot set an interval like ""every other week"". I work a 9/80 work schedule and I want to have every other Friday that I work in my phone so I know when I'm off work or not. I can only choose daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. So while it does take Outlook calendar items, they end up so flawed and useless that if you really do plan on using this phone as an organizer, don't; it will fail to meet your needs. I understand that Samsung uses this same calendar in many of its products and if so, it will be a deal breaker next time around for me and I'll shop a different brand. The add-on Mobile Email from OZ isn't too bad but it also has room for improvement. It is billed as ""fully integrated"" but not in my eyes. While the phone itself has a limited file viewer for certain file types stored on it, if you receive an email with attachments (even if just a .jpg), the OZ mobile email doesn't support accessing attachments. This is not what I call ""fully integrated"". The OZ email client also works a bit inconsistently (although maybe it's an issue with the email providers and not OZ?). With my Cox POP3 accounts, I can only access the inbox (not sent items). With Yahoo and Hotmail, I can access the various folders OK. With my university's email account (hosted by Google GMAIL), it displays both the inbox and the sent items in the inbox (really weird, and I imagine if I had other folders it might lump everything togeter as well). The user interface for the OZ mobile email isn't too bad although it was a bit unintuitive to find how to add a recipient to an email from the phone's contacts. Can be done but just was hard to find. Also isn't clear on how to add multiple recipients (use a comma or semicolon between them? don't know...) Beware of Verizon's compusory data plan with this phone. It is misleading. Supposedly for $9.99 a month you get 25MB of data usage. This often isn't presented clearly. It applies only to the web browser. Texting and picture messaging are not part of this 25MB **even though they use a data connection!**. It should be called a ""web browsing plan"", not a ""data plan"". So unless you pay for an additional texting plan, you will be charged for each message. I was pretty furious when my first bill arrived to find I was charged for the picture messages I sent thinking it was part of my ""data plan"". The mp3 player is alright although once or twice it froze up on me and I had to restart the phone. The headphone jack is a nontypical 2.5mm so you will need an adapter to go to 3.5mm. Booooo. Battery life is so-so. If at work I listen to mp3s during the day and also do a little lunchtime web browsing for about 10-15 minutes, I can easily go from a full battery to dead in about 5-6 hours. I don't know if this is typical or not of most phones, but it'd be nice if the mp3s can make it through one whole workday, but it can't. Sound on the built-in speakers is decent for something so small."
83,"I loved my Samsung Alias, as most Alias owners do. I decided to purchase the Alias 2 on faith, assuming that Samsung had simply updated certain features of the original. I was mistaken. The first thing you will notice is the size; the alias 2 is taller, thicker, and wider than the original. If you are like me, one of the reasons you bought the original alias was it's super-slim design. I would say it's about 50% bulkier than the original. While the original slid into your jeans and disappeared, the new one will stick out like a sore thumb. I suppose the increase in size supports the new and improved camera/camcorder but I never used that feature too much in the first place. Ultimately, I would say this is the reason I returned the alias 2, but I also did not care for the much ballyhooed liquid ink screen. When texting, you must toggle through 3 screens to find all the numbers/symbols/punctuation marks that you need. In fact, the third screen only had a scant number of symbols on it, so the empty space is frustrating when toggling to the first screen for the letters. The empty space is a theme on all screens in fact, in either orientation. As I said, I found this annoying (maybe only because I became so used to the 1000 figures/symbols crammed onto the original alias phone pad). I ended up returning the alias 2 and going back to the original. I will keep my new every 2 discount until Verizon comes out with a very good Android or Apple finally relents with the iphone/At&T exclusivity."
85,"The messaging features are nice. Typing text messages is not so much of a hassle with the keyboard. Also, the screen is quite pretty. I have found the morphing keyboard to be a great feature. When receiving calls, the phone works over half the time, but it sometimes resets when I attempt to answer calls. Also, at other times it lights up when a call is coming in, but won't actually finish the process and start ringing, so I don't know who actually called until they tell me later. I'm beginning to kick myself for signing a contract for service with this phone, and I suspect that it is going to be a pain in the butt until the contract is up."
86,"I have been using this phone for a few days now and I like it. I am not a big ""gadget phone"" fan, preferring a simpler device that does just what I want. The voice quality is acceptable and after a short learning cycle is easy to use. The Alias 2 allows me, a novice texter, to send and receive text messages with no real hassles. The keypad is a great size, even for my larger fingers. I would have given 5 stars, except for the learning curve required to figure the phone out. Not that this is bad, but it is definitely different than the older phones I was used to."
87,"I've had this phone for a couple of months. It's pretty cool in the way the screen and keypad can be used in either portrait or landscape. However, the keys don't have good tactile feedback. I have to type with my fingernail in order to press the keys hard enough and accurately. Its voice recognition software is worthless, so if you are accustomed to using this feature to dial (such as in the car using an earpiece), don't bother. The camera and camcorder work very well and the quality of the pictures and display are really good. The battery in this phone doesn't last near as long as my old LG, however this phone has many more features, so I think the battery life is acceptable. It's got a sleek design and it's fun to use, however, I don't think I'd buy another one because of the usability issues."
88,"My Alias 2 keeps shutting off, even with a full charge. I thought it might be a problem with my battery until my husband's phone started doing the same thing...several times a day! Since then, we have heard of two other people having the same problem with the Alias 2. The local Verizon store offered a software update, but with no guarantee that it would correct the problem. They claim that this phone wasn't a big seller, and they have never heard of this problem before. They refuse to look into the problem, saying that's just the nature of electronic devices...no guarantees. Anyone else having this problem?"
89,"Had a Samsung A-310 for 6 years...a die-hard, sturdy phone. Wanted the same, with improved features. Looked for a flip phone (no purse-calling) that was intuitive, and had decent-sized keys to start texting - and this is it. You have SOOOO much room, because the keyboard changes with your need. Easy to use - intuitive for basic functions. If you choose to read the manual, there is a LOT more there. It's wonderful - thanks Samsung!!!"
90,"Overall I like the phone for its call quality. I love the keyboard and find it very easy to type text messages. I haven't used the camera or the Bluetooth features. I can access my email accounts easily. The main problem with the phone is that locks up when I attempt to use the MP3 player. I have an 8GB MicroSD card with all of my music on it. I hook the phone up to my car radio to play it. Everything was fine for the first month, but now the phone locks up or freezes when it's in media mode and the only way to unlock it is to remove and then replace the battery. Very annoying. The phone has also turned off several times when I was attempting to answer a call."
91,"This is a excellent phone great talk time, excellent standby, very user friendly, I may state it takes a little time to get use to but so does it when you change to new anything. The only down fall is the top 3 keys when your texting when you have large fingers, besides that I would recommend this phone to anybody my wife and kids go through phones like water so had many phones but this one is very unique exspecially with the flip screen. The pictures are excellent minus not having a flash i can live with that cause in low light still takes excellent pics. The flashes on all other phones are a joke those are only good for a couple of foot so take how you want but I recommend this phone for anybody men or women is is very unique. Only gripe is for my wife could be in different colors but my gripe is 3 top buttons could be different thanks for reading Jeff."
92,"Don't bother with this piece of junk. It is the worst phone I have ever owned. Turns itself off inexplicably 15 times a day. Shuts down in the middle of a conversation. So embarrassing. If you ""close"" it too fast, it shuts down. Also, the body of the phone is way too ""slippery"" --- I have dropped it out of my hand a dozen times only because it's too darn slippery to hold. Impossible to flip open the phone with one hand, you need both hands to open it. Terrible product. I am thinking about quitting Verizon simply because they offer this POS phone. Don't waste your time or money with this junk."
93,"I got mine for free with the purchase of my wife's blackberry. With the understanding that this is not a full computer, its a great tool tpo give you quick access to the internet. I really don't like working on lap tops, so only own a desktop. This leaves me limited in where I can have access to the internet. This thing gives me access everywhere. I have wireless in the house and I use the broadband everywhere else. Because it is only a netbook it does have its limitations. If you are looking for a full featured machine, this is not for you. But for quick access to the internet and most files, its great."
94,"Pros: Creative use of buttons, big screen, qwerty keyboard Cons: Doesn't sync with Outlook, clunky user interface, muddled audio in ear piece/speakerphone I really have to give credit to Samsung because of the creatively designed keypad, but I don't recommend this phone overall. The phone user interface isn't simple, and is made somewhat more complicated because they keyboard layout is constantly changing based on what screen you're on. For example, there's an awkward key layout in some versions of the layout, takes too many keystrokes to do things like turn off an alarm (I guess I've been spoiled by almost always owning Nokias, as they tend to have the best-designed user interfaces). Aside from the clumsy UI, the biggest thing that killed this for our family was its inability to sync contacts and calendar events with Outlook. Maybe there's a way to do it with a combination of MyVerizon and USB cables, but its not worth the effort, especially when I can switch to a Nokia that takes care of it (as an aside, I switched to AT&T a week later because of the poor phone selection at Verizon. Also, Verizon disables any Bluetooth syncing capabilities with Outlook, even for the few Nokias they offer.) Overall, the phone is designed creatively, but its hip design doesn't make up for its poor UI and lack of features that were essential to me."
96,Has some real ram issues. It is really unusable. It takes a good 3 minutes just to run a program. I got mine for free for signing up for Fios and I feel like I got ripped off. I thought it would be a nice little thing because we only have 1 computer in my house. But really this can be used for nothing more than a paper weight. DO NOT BUY. I had to give 1 star because 0 stars wasn't an option.
97,"Great phone, which has the comfort of a larger phone, mixed with a very easy to use qwerty keyboard. the keyboard has nice space, and a texture that feels like the kindle. With the touch of a button, the QWERTY turns into 1234, or /?!> ect. Just a need phone, highly recommended."
98,"I have had this fone for two years, and have not had one problem with it.......love the magic keys.....will wait till the Alias 3 comes out to upgrade and it better have the magic keys!"
99,I just got this phone a couple days ago and I am in love. It works great. Texting is a breeze. Great size.
100,"The first time I heard about the Samsung Alias I thought I was in for a unique phone/messaging experience. After all, it contains the E Ink powered keyboard technology where keys can transform from vertical to horizontal and from regular to QWERTY keyboard at the touch of a button and using the dual-flip style that makes this phone more than just the typical flip phone. The first release had its faults, which is why Samsung and Verizon have released the Alias 2. The phone has its improvements. The best one is the fact that, when flipped open sideways, you get enough room to navigate and type with the QWERTY keyboard. The keys are not as crammed in together as the first Alias, for more comfortable typing. The phone also contains GPS, VCast Music with Rhapsody, web e-mail , IM capabilities and a mobile web browser. You can use these features with Verizon's fast EV-DO/3 G network. The phone also has a user-friendly menu and beautiful internal and external display. It's got 80 MB of internal memory (memory expandable to 16 GB with a media card) and a 2 MP camera with some nice, though limited video-recording capabilities. The Alias 2, though an improvement from the original Alias, has its downsides. For one thing, it looks outdated. At a mere glance, it looks like a typical flip phone that's been out for years. It only comes in one color (grayish black), and there's nothing about it that makes it attractive or unique at first glance. The keys are difficult to press. I had to press the keys rather hard every time I used the QWERTY keyboard. My thumbs ached after a while. The OS is quirky. It froze on me quite a few times and I had to do a force reboot. Very annoying when you're in the middle of sending a text message or checking your e-mail. And that's another thing, the calling, or lack thereof. I had about three dropped calls in one day. That's a lot for a phone, especially when I had most if not all network bars. What gives? And last but not least, the phone contains the same old Verizon menu and looks. The only nice thing about it is that you can personalize the internal and external screens with some cute animated wallpaper or other. All in all, the Samsung Alias 2 has all the makings for a popular messaging/multimedia phone. However, I don't think it's quite ready for prime time yet. A slicker design would be nice as well as some improved features and smoother keys. If you're in the bargain for a messaging phone that's stylish as well as functional, and you're in the Verizon network, I strongly recommend the LG enV3 or the enV Touch. You cannot go wrong with those two phones. In the meantime, if you really want this phone, make sure you weigh in the pros and cons before you decide to commit to it for two long years."
101,"Let me preface this review with a disclaimer: I am NOT a techie nor a tycoon who needs continual internet access lest the global market crash. I need a basic phone, and want a few bells and whistles. I replaced a basic LG cell phone with the Alias2 on the recommendation of a friend. I immediately liked the heftier feel and the easier to read displays, though I swiftly changed the rather twee and hard to figure out menu page. Pros: I LOVE having dedicated keys for voicemail, bluetooth and voice menus. The rotating keypad is just too cool for words, and though I don't send many texts, I use the notepad all the time. The QWERTY keyboard is very easy to use, even with fingernails. It's nice to know I can check email and have internet access if necessary, though I probably never will. The camera is great, and I like the editing options for pictures. The screen size is generous and easy to see, especially in landscape mode. It's easy to use. Sound quality is good. Nice long life of battery charge. Cons: The default backgrounds, though those are easy enough to change. Some functions are difficult to find on the menus. That's how I found the voicemail key--couldn't find VM on a menu. The ring isn't loud enough to be heard when the phone is in a jacket pocket--but I've never found a phone with a loud enough ring. There's not a button on the outside that will light up the display--to check the time, you have to open the phone. (ETA: Yes, there is--it just takes a few seconds for the display to light. Duh.) This phone was a good choice for me, and I'm very happy with it."
102,"Calls are fine; battery life is terrific compared to the LG phone I just discarded. Nearly identical software found on every other Verizon phone I've had, yet the standard issue ring tones on this one are pretty bad. Great camera, HOWEVER, no support Bluetooth file system profile -- nor support for marking multiple photos for push, meaning that I have to push each picture painfully and slowly one by one to my PC via Bluetooth. So I should be done pushing the 100 or so pics I took today in about 28 days... lovely. Also, END key is right next to the SPACE key. If you inadvertently tap END while using the mobile web, it exits no matter what/where you are and it is absolutely maddening while you're trying to learn the keypad layout. Time on the front display is permanently set to 12-hr mode. I don't think I'm going to keep this one for long."
103,"The real standout feature on this phone is keyboard. I made the mistake of assuming that the mp3 bluetooth audio would be at least as good as my original LG chocolate from 3 years ago, especially since verizon just copies its old OS onto everything. The bluetooth stereo is almost unusable, very tinny, no way to adjust the sound profile. If you plug a wire in it sounds great, but not very useful. Phone call quality is ok. it has a spot for upto 16GB card, which would be perfect if it was useful as an MP3 player. If it wasn't too late to return it , I would. Also the Voice recognition is not accurate or useful, something else that used to work flawlessly with my 3yr old chocolate."
104,"As a teenager, I do a lot of texting. This phone has a great full QWERTY keyboard or if you want, a number pad. The changing keys are cool and people go ooo! and ahh! as they see you flip it both ways. The 2 megapixel camera is good for recording video and photos. There is only a small piece holding the screen to the bottom unit in the corner that seems flimsy from the pictures. It is NOT a flimsy device. This was not a problem. In fact, while walking home on a trail I dropped it without realizing it. The next day I was looking for it all over. When I was walking on the trail I noticed it in the mud. I was mortified because people drive ATV/Quads all over the trail. Upon lifting up the phone I saw that it had been run over and caked in mud. I knew it was not going to work because of how wet it was. Amazingly, it worked fine. I got home and brushed it with a paper towel. It's as good as new. The only problem is that you have to change the keyboard layout in order to get to the numbers. This makes it just as hard to type the number 4 as it is to type four. It's a nice reliable little phone. If you are interested in a standard phone for texting and calling, this is great for you. Pros: Durable Reliable good for texting Cons: A little slow sometimes It's slippery Not a smartphone but it's a cheap one The best secret feature is that if you scratch the back a certain way it makes a cool noise like scratching a record."
105,"I love the e-ink technology (the qwerty keyboard is great for texting), but that is the highlight. The huge drawback, if you need to make calls with the bluetooth, is that the voice activation system is useless. My old phone worked flawelessly in this area, but with the Alias 2, if I say, ""Call John Smith,"" IF it responds (and many times it doesn't), it will say, ""Did you say dial 123?"" or some other number, or name that is nothing like the one I've said. It's incredibly frustrating. I don't want to look at my phone as I am driving, that is why I rely on the Voice Activation/Bluetooth to make my calls. Without voice activation working properly, I am looking at my phone, scrolling through my address book, and just generally distracted instead of focusing on the road. SO DISAPPOINTING."
106,"I got this thing and loved it. It is great mini computer for everyday on the go use. Nice size, screen is not too small but not too big either. Keyboard is just as easy to use as a large keyboard. Operating system if you get it in XP works well on this little PC. It does just about everything a large one would do but more portable. I would recommend!"
107,"My daughter and I both got the LG enV2 about 8 months ago. We're currently waiting for our third version of this. Both phones of our first phones failed within 5 months (keys stopped working on outside, dropped calls, goes back to menu in middle of texting, calls contacts at random times and much more). We got ""new"" ones, which were refurbished phones from Verizon. They lasted a few months before failing with similar problems, plus now I have almost no volume even though its maxed on the setting. We're waiting for our next set of ""new"" phones to arrive later this week. Can't wait to see how long these last. The upgrade to a different phone isn't an option until you've been in the contract one year and can only upgrade one phone then."
108,Problem: phone was phased out by AT&T so i couldn't even use it or buy sim card or anything for it! AT&T should inform sellers!!
110,This is the third phone I've purchased for my son since we switched him to AT&T. The first two were the same phone and were no good within a few months. This one has lasted him almost a year now. He likes it and I like not having to replace it all the time.
113,It's exactly what I was looking for. Nice and simple. I would recommend this to anyone looking for less technical.
114,Brand new - out of the box - I charged this phone as instructed (four hours - I gave it six) and when unplugged - black screen. I am returning to Amazon.
117,"We were looking for an attractive, pre-paid cell phone and this fit the bill. It's easy to use, has good battery life, and includes a serviceable camera. The phone is comfortable to use (something that couldn't be said for the Motorola flip phones), snaps closed with a solid feel, and the menus are straightforward. Call quality with AT&T is very good. There are two things that could be improved: there should be a way to get photos off the phone without having to send a video text message, and it would be nice to be able to import phone numbers from a PC. For the price though it's no big deal. Other than those quibbles we're very happy with the phone."
118,"If you are looking for something simple that has great call quality this is the phone. I researched low SAR (absorbed radiation) and this was the cheapest most simple phone available. My other phone was ancient, so this feels like a huge step up. Love the speakerphone, internal antenna. The camera doesn't take super clear pictures, but my other phone didn't have a camera at all - so still a step up. Overall pleased with how it functions and quality of calls."
119,"HIGHS- good sound quality, good reception, and decent battery life LOWS- VERY small cheap feeling plastic buttons, confusing menu, no flash"
120,I saw this phone at Best Buy for the same price but with $30 included air time
121,"I bought this off of ""I sell things"". It is the wrong color, scratched and beat up badly! It's not worth the postage to return or exchange it! My daughter worked hard for this and got crap!"
122,"I was told on the phone, by Amazon customer support, that this phone had Bluetooth capability. The Amazon website even shows you bluetooth headsets as ""available accessories"". However, this phone doe not support either bluetooth or wireless headsets. I guess that is why it is so cheap. I had to return the phone. Inside the packaging, Samsung had a picture of a ""corded"" headset you could purchase for this phone."
126,"First of all I need to delete my lst review since there was much confusion when I tried to activate this phone with Verizon. This phone does not go by IMEI, it goes by DEC and HEX, the Verizon rep didn't look on Verizon guildelines as I finally did but thought it was an obsolete phone. The problem was Verizon's not the seller. The 2nd Verizon rrep got the phone activated. The seller called me and asked me to remove my negative comment which I am attempting to do. I ended up returning the phone because it wouldn't hold the charge. The seller generously gave me not only my sale price but refunded both postage to and from the seller."
128,"Horrible purchase. Came today and first thing I noticed is it is far from ""like new"". Looks like my 5 yr old has been playing with it a few yrs. Avoid at all costs. I guess its cheap for a reason. Dont waste your money"
129,"After only having this phone for a month it won't charge. First of all I ordered a pink one for my daughter and it arrived in silver. The charger that was included was clearly not the factory Motorola charger. When I plug in the phone now it displays a message saying that it is unable to charge. I have not tried an alternate charger yet, but I shouldn't have to. The one that came with the phone should work."
130,"The phone arrived with some scratches on the front and back, and I was a little disappointed when I saw the keypad was weathered and worn more than I'd like, but considering it's an 8+ year old phone, it's in very good condition. The screen, dial pad, speaker, everything works as it should. Had no problem activating it on to my existing verizon account. The included charger works great, however the battery was pretty weak, it only lasts about 10 hours or so on a full charge. Just order a replacement battery to be safe, (they're a few bucks) the phone lasts for days now with the new battery. Good phone though, good seller"
131,"I have this "" sane phone "" in "" Paris Hilton Red "". The Phone is "" Simply Awesome "" . Has "" All Great Cell Phone Features '. I Love It some much ---------- I'm "" soon going to pruchase this same phone again "" ! Would recommend this order and cell phone to "" Any And All Amazon Cusotmers "" Sinply Becasue It Is A Superior Cell Phone "" !"
132,"DISAPOINTED! phone was great, but the ""new"" battery wouldn't hold a charge long before dying. This was for my 78 yr old disabled dad and he can't use it. Too much of a hassle spent charging all the time."
135,"Bought this phone used (but claimed to be refurbished), and it was supposed to be fully tested and functional. It is not. First, the battery would not hold a charge, so bought a new OEM battery. Plugged it into the supplied (with the phone) charger, and received an error message that the charger was not an authorized Motorola charger. Bought a new charger (now we;'re up to $28.99 for the phone, $6.22 for the OEM battery, and $3.50 for the new charger. The phone refuses to work. Was able to activate it over the internet via computer, but the phone itself has internal problems. It starts, then flickers and dies. Repeated attempts to make it work were useless. Even tried using the phone with the charger still plugged in, and no luck. It lights up, flickers, and then dies, over and over. This phone was not refurbished, nor even tested. It's used, and its internals do not work properly. By the time I got the new battery, and then waited for the new charger and finally was able to use the phone, it was too late to take any action about the phone's failure to even operate in basic mode. I've got what amounts to a $40 paperweight. Be very wary about buying used phones, esp those that claim to be ""refurbished"" and fully functional. You get what you pay for, and in the case of used, or refurbished phones, you're taking a big risk that it'll even work, much less be fully functional. Lesson learned. No more used phones, nor dealing with sellers of these products."
136,I bought this for my mom. She had a smartphone but didn't like it. She loves this phone and it isn't in to bad of condition. It can be a little glitchy at times and had also turned off for no reason a couple times. The charging port is very loose and that could be reason it randomly turns off. It is a used phone and I dont think I would get another one.
138,Lovely memories are in my hand!
140,Got it in the mail way way late and then I charged it over night. I went to turn it on and it would light up on the front screen but only for a second and then go black. I never could get it to turn on and wasn't able to hook it up to the line I needed it on. Returns take forever and I really needed a phone so I wound up having to just buy another one. Money doesn't grow on trees. When you buy a product that they guarantee is in working condition they should make sure it is.
142,"This phone was advertised as Used - Mint Condition!!! When I received it, the phone looked like new and I was very excited to put the battery in and let it charge before calling my phone company to make the transfer. Once the back was removed, the phone was clearly a REFURBISHED phone from the manufacturer. Reluctantly, I placed the battery and let it charge for 12 hours until it said charge complete. I turned the phone on and let it sit for 24 hours without using it. The next day, it was totally drained. I repeated the steps again to just be sure and this time, I let the phone charge for 24 hours. Again ,I left the phone and low and behold, it was totally drained. This phone was either damaged, or had a battery problem which I will never know. I will not buy from these people again. I have to now pay for a return shipping and waste more time taking it to UPS and wait for the credit to be issued.....AGGRAVATING....."
143,Bad battery and other problems
144,"This phone is great. Does just what it should and I think it is better made than most of the lower end phones a person can buy now days. They seem to be more fragile, lighter weight and cheaply made. This phone takes really nice pictures, too. It isn't iPad quality, but for the price I am very happy."
145,"These are great phones. My wife's old one had a broken screen, so I replaced this and my son's non RAZR phone. We had good experience with the RAZR, so we decided to get 2 this time. I ""upgraded"" both phones online without any issues. We have an old Verizon plan, didn't want to pay the required data plan for a new smart phone, and didn't like their current non-smart phones. I'm guessing that Verizon intentional had some bad non-smart phones so people would lean towards the more profitable smart phones and plans. We only use our phones for calls, so this was a great alternative to getting a Verizon store offered phone. I am a long time Verizon customer, but would have switched to another provider than pay for an unnecessary data plan if I had to. I am happy I can keep my old plan, and not have to switch to their newer plans. Note that Verizon customer support did not volunteer this upgrade option (buying replacement phone from non-Verizon store) until I asked them directly. I also could not get my GetItNow or BackupAssitant (contact auto-sync) to work on these legacy/unsupported Verizon phones. Not a show stopper for me since I printed (but wasted too much paper--wished they had a simple list view) the contacts that were already in the contacts online from my old, broken phone, and just manually copy/backup the numbers now. Also we (wife and I) don't use GetItNow (much). Too bad since I thought BackupAssistant was one of Verizon's better, more useful features, especially when upgrading phones. It was (and still is) annoying that they didn't upgrade their error messge when trying to run GetItNow/Get_New_App from ""Unable to retrieve catalog. Please try again later. (3332)"" to ""Legacy/unsupported phone. Don't waste your time to try again"". If I didn't see the reviews for this error, I think I would have wasted my time with Verizon support since I didn't see any positive feedback (good/simple solutions) yet. If they wanted to fix the issue, they would of had a good, simple resolution a few years ago, not just possibly getting support at a Verizion store, and possibly getting an unusable phone at the end. Again, my online ""upgrade/replacement"" of my phone was simple and straigtforward, and my phone calls are working fine. I wouldn't think Verison would make much money from supporting or if they still sold these old/legacy phones, so fixing/maintaining their sofware for them would be a very low priority (they wouldn't want say they give no support to their existing phones). At the end, I am still happy I could keep my old (non-data) plan, fix/replace my phone, even though I don't have BackupAssitant. Phone and phone call quality is still 5 stars. Verizon's GetItNow and BackupAssitant support of these legacy Verizon phones, 2 stars."
147,Good phone! Phone arrived kind of dirty but phone works great!
149,"This is an old school Motorola phone, but works well and is reliable. The only thing I am not crazy aout is that the battery doesn't last long. It really needs to be plugged in each night. I bought a newer battery, but it still doesn't last that long."
150,"Very delayed, asked if it had any noticeable defects knowing it was refurbished/used, but was assured it worked great. Extremely delayed navigating from contacts to messages, and so on. Going to have to buy another phone."
151,I really like this phone. It has better reception than my last phone. Less dropped calls and clearer voice reception. Like the size and how easily it opens. I am even getting used to the pink color.
155,"I specifically ordered this particular phone because of the ""little to no scratches"" , not the case here. Screen is scratched inside and out, the phone looks like it was dropped on the corners a dozen times at least, scratches on the back also. This seller needs to be a lot more specific to the condition of the phone. Pictures would be an excellent idea, I didn't turn the phone on yet I hope it works."
156,"Motorola razr gets a 4 star, basic flip phone, easy to activate. Device can take a memory card for music and photos. That was a nice surprise. Haven't used it yet to give an first hand opinion. Doesn't hold a charge for more than a day. However will re-charge very quickly. Heavy users, better carry a battery pack. People may say wow they still sell those! But if your not into the smartphone phenomenon, this phone will suit you well."
157,I was not able to activate the phone (the numbers I needed off of the back were missing).Some numbers on the phone did not work. I had to pay for shipping to receive it and to ship it back. I was only refunded the amount I paid for the phone.
158,"ESN of the phone does not match the Verizon ESN printed on the sticker in the battery compartment. Consequently, Verizon will not activate phone. Wasted $30."
159,"I have had 3 of these phones, this one will not snc to the bluetooth in my car like m other one did, it is the old programming, and it cannot be up dated--I want to return this for a full credit, lets see how I get jerked aroud now"
160,my phone would not connect to the network and it was a verison network and screwed around with it for 2 hours. Never doing that again.
162,"The phone arrived just within the time frame for delivery. The outside was in excellent condition and looked almost new. The inside, however, was dirty and had traces of chocolate! The phone performs all of its functions except that the memory card reader does not work. All in all, considering I was looking for a quick replacement for a phone that wasn't working properly, I am happy with the purchase and the price."
163,"I purchased this rather basic piece of equipment ""used"" assuming that the risk of defect was low. I got burned. The device will not power down completely without pulling the battery. Also, the battery is completely depleted after approx 30 mins of talk. The only reason I didn't returned it is because I had already given it to my elderly mother. Plus, I didn't want to expend more of my valuable returning it. The cost was less than $50."
165,"I bought this for my husband because he doesn't like or want a smartphone. He had an older version of this phone, many years old, and it lasted forever until the battery finally gave out. For about $50 more I was able to get him this new one. It is a great little phone, very slim and light, and the camera and standard features work great. Would recommend for someone who just wants a phone for making and receiving calls, simple texts, and a few pictures here and there."
167,I find this phone to be one of the finest basic phones available. This is my second one. The original lasted six years with one battery replacement. For the money you will not find a better basic phone.
169,"this phone is terrible, as soon as i received the phone i realized that it wasnt charging at all...dont buy a used phone from amazon...its terrible. when i plug the chaarger it says complete charge after 1 or 2 min of using the phone it starts saying low battery...i had to talk on the phone while it was pluged on the wall...bad experience hopefully ill get a complete refund.."
170,Timely arrival. Phone condition was as advertised. Life of battery seems to be OK. Only disappointment in moving it to my Verizon account was that the pictures I had on the phone wouldn't transfer to this one. Contact phone numbers transferred OK.
172,Delivered on time. Better than new.
